Just fork the repository and create PR's, but we use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to optimal release the plugin.

standard-version is following the [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification which follows the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)
